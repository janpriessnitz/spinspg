  \begin{definition}[Internal direct product]
    Let $G$ be a group.
    If $G$ has normal subgroups $H, K \trianglelefteq G$ such that $HK = G$ and $H \cap K = \{ 1 \}$, $G$ is called a \term{internal direct product} of $H$ and $K$, denoted as $G = H \times K$.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}[Internal semidirect product]
    Let $G$ be a group.
    If $G$ has a normal subgroup $N \trianglelefteq G$ and a subgroup $H \leq G$ such that $NH = G$ and $N \cap H = \{ 1 \}$, $G$ is called a \term{internal semidirect product} of $N$ and $H$, denoted as $G = N \rtimes H = H \ltimes N$.
  \end{definition}
\end{screen}

If group $G = N \rtimes H$ is a semidirect product, there is a group homomorphism $\phi: H \to \mathrm{Aut}(N)$ with $\phi(h)(n) = h n h^{-1}$ for $h \in H$ and $n \in N$.
We also write the semidirect product as $G = N \rtimes_{\phi} H = H \ltimes_{\phi} N$.

A group is not necessarily a semidirect product of its nontrivial normal subgroup and a subgroup.
The cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ is a counterexample.
$\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ has an exact sequence $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \overset{\iota}{\hookrightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_{4} \overset{\times 2}{\twoheadrightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_{2}$, where $\iota: \mathbb{Z}_{2} \ni n \mapsto n \in \mathbb{Z}_{4}$ and $\times 2: \mathbb{Z}_{4} \ni n \mapsto 2n \in \mathbb{Z}_{2}$.
However, if $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ was a semidirect product $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_{2}$, it would be isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}$ because $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_{2}) = \{ 1 \}$.
