\section{Spin arrangement and spin symmetry operation}

A \term{spin symmetry operation} $(g, \bm{W}) \in \mathrm{E}(3) \times \mathrm{O}(3)$ acts on a pair of position $\bm{r}$ and magnetic moments $\bm{m}$,
\begin{align}
  (g, \bm{W}) (\bm{r}, \bm{m}) \coloneqq (g \bm{r}, \bm{Wm}).
\end{align}
A \term{spin arrangement} is a set of pairs of magnetic moments and a crystal structure.
